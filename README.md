# google_photos_takeout_organizer

This is a script that helps organize photos downloaded from your google photos backup. I found that the format of the download is
not very well organized and so I made this script to organize it according to year, month and day. 

The file "organizar.py" will organize photos with the data from jpg metadata

The second uses the format of the folders of the download and it worked very well.
