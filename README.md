# google_photos_takeout_organizer

This is a script that helps organize photos downloaded from your google photos backup. I found that the format of the download is
not very well organized and so I made this script to organize it according to year, month and day. 

The first file "organizar.py" was meant to organize the photos according to their metadata, but I soon found that it was not possible
for .png format to have metadata storing the time the photo was taken. I kept it in the repository just because I don't want to get rid of it.
The second uses the format of the folders of the download and it worked very well.
